same folder as the application.

Guide on effects of Axiom parameters.
------------------------------------

Level:   Increasing the level increases the size & complexity
         and vice-versa.  If the image is then too large it
         can be reduced by setting a smaller YStep and/or the
         YStep multiplier.  A maximum level is set in the prog
	 to give a maximum LSys string of around 1MB.  Beyond
	 this is not really necessary and could give rise to an
	 'Out of memory' error.
Angles:  There are positive(P) and negative(N) angles. Swapping
         them produces a mirror image.
XStep:   Changing this causes the image to bend over to the
         left or right.
YStep:   This is applied linearly as the drawing progresses and
         so sets the basic size of the image.  Negative values
         draw upwards.
XStepMult:  This will increase or decrease the sideways stretch
            as the drawing proceeds.
YStepMult:  Like XStepMult but for vertical stretch.

LSys parameters catered for:
---------------------------

F   Draw, advance pen
G   Advance pen
[   Push (save) current pen position
]   Pop (restore) previously saved pen position
+   Turn to left through angle zAngP
-   Turn to right through angle zAngN

NB These are basic 'turtle' codes and are a sub-set of the full 
LSys codes.  However, with the externally defined angles, steps, 
multipliers & colors the whole system is close to the full LSys
specification.

There is only one level of Undo which simply swaps the current
picture with the previous picture - so Undoing again brings
back the current picture.

Double_click on the clear screen button to clear the screen.

If you develop your own axiom formulae it will be important to
check that there are matched brackets [ ].

If any bits of the hills are not filled in then right-click on
those areas to fill in with the StartColor.

The picture can only be saved as BMP.

VB allows BMP, JPG & GIF files to be loaded, which can then be
added to (metafiles could be included).

The menu VB button toggles between VB & ASM.

Timings are just for the translation and drawing phase and do not
include the the axiom expansion using the Replace function.

The ASM routine LSysDraw.asm (LSysDraw.bin) translates the LSys 
string and draws to a Long array (PICArray) which is then blitted
to the screen - it is much faster than using the VB Line methods.
It could easily be converted to a DLL - eg see NASM Editor,
assembler & Tutorial on PSC and A1VBCode.

It is of interest to note that the expanded Axiom string is copied
to a 1D byte array.  Even with the copying it is much faster to
scan a byte array than a string array.  Also a byte array is more
easily scanned in ASM.

Good luck!
